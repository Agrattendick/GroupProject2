Almost everyone loves ice cream, even the lactose intolerant. What are the most beloved flavors though? Chocolate? Vanilla? Cookie Dough? These questions can be answered through our project. 

We will look into the popularity of various flavors of Ben & Jerry's ice cream accross the United States.<br/> 

This is accomplished by counting the number of stores selling various flavors. Initally our results will be limited to St. Louis, then expanded to Missouri and finally to the rest of the United States. While the data in our local area will be fairly specific as we broaden our area the paramaters will be generalized. In the St. Louis area we'll use zip codes and addresess but with the entire United States serches are limited to States.<br/>

Once we have our data compiled we'll analyize it for patterns. To see if some flavors are not only more popular than others, but if that popularity is location dependent. Do those uppity Washington University students get picky about their artistic flavors or will they suffer through mint chip?<br/>

# Data
Our data comes from these sources:<br/>
[Ben & Jerry's API](https://github.com/fab/benandjerrys_api)<br/>
We'll scrape the web for St. Louis area codes. 


# Bonus
For fun and if we have time our group will compare our data of Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream popularity with something completely whimsical. Some possible ideas are:<br/>

Crime | Politics | UFO's
------|----------|-------
Does crime in the area influnce flavor choice? Are people more willing to rob a bank to buy chocolate or vanilla ice cream? | Does an areas political leaning affect popular flavors? | Do people eating more Americone Dream see more UFO's than the rest of us?
